# Formulations Imaging
Imaging formulations samples for phase stability analysis

The `opencv` python module is used to control a Logitech webcam for imaging purposes. Open the relevant directory in command window/terminal and enter `python -m webcam_image` to execute the script.
This brings up a pop-up window showing the camera's image. Press space to capture an image and follow the prompts in the command window/terminal to give the sample a name etc.
